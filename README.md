# TimeSeries Analysis

**Objective:**
Forecasting foreign tourists’ arrivals in Indonesia

**Problem Statement:**
As the largest archipelagic nation, Indonesia has a lot of cultures and national parks that can be utilized to improve the economy of Indonesia. Bali, Yogyakarta, Labuan Bajo, and Lombok are one of many regions in Indonesia that has a lot of foreign tourists, and many local people are dependent on tourism sector. However, Indonesia’s tourism sector is having a significant setback due to COVID-19. The Government set a road map to reinvigorate Indonesia’s tourism sector as Indonesia’s [new source of economic growth](https://tasransel.kemenparekraf.go.id/outlook-pariwisata-dan-ekonomi-kreatif-2023-2024/show). In addition, foreign tourists also potentially can increase foreign reserve in Indonesia. Because of those situations (source of economic growth and post-COVID 19 economic recovery), we want to forecast tourists arrivals in Indonesia.

**Data Description:**
The data of foreign tourism (tourists) is a monthly time series from January 1979 to August 2023. Statistics Indonesia defined the tourist data as inbound tourists arriving in Indonesia by mode of transportation. They also defined tourist as any person taking a trip to a main destination outside his/her usual environment, staying at least 24 hours, but not more than 12 (twelve) months, for any main purpose (business, leisure, or other personal purpose) other than to be employed by a resident entity in the country visited. 

<!---This series (Figure 1) has several main features:
- Trend pattern: long-term exponential increase in the data since January 1979 until before COVID-19 and right after COVID-19.
- Structural break: Tourists arrival in Indonesia dropped significantly as the whole world restricted people’s mobility.
- Seasonal pattern: rise and fall with a fixed and known period (rise during holiday season/ summer and winter period)-->
